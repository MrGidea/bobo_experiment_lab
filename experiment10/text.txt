Nestled in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, Harbin, one of the nation's chilliest cities, has emerged as a rising star in the country's burgeoning winter tourism scene.
The unprecedented influx of tourists, captivated by the enchanting icy landscapes and warm hospitality of this Chinese "ice city," has propelled Harbin, despite its frosty climate, to the forefront as the most talked-about and sought-after travel destination in China over the past month.
According to official statistics, over the course of the recent three-day New Year holiday, Harbin attracted a staggering number of over 3 million visitors, generating a record-breaking 5.9 billion yuan (about $830 million) in tourism revenue.
This travel surge has been fueled by the concerted efforts of Harbin's services sector, government authorities and local residents, who have been diligently working together to offer personalized and attentive services to "spoil" their guests from nearby or afar, addressing visitors' needs promptly and leaving no stone unturned in ensuring a delightful experience for tourists.
In addition to the widely praised convenience of the shuttle buses, complimentary heating houses for visitors, and local drivers volunteering to provide free rides, some of the most-discussed highlights involve an artificial moon soaring over the city's Saint Sophia Cathedral and people of the Oroqen ethnic group parading around tourist attractions in traditional attire, accompanied by their iconic reindeer.
