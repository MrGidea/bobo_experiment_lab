
An aerial cityscape video titled This is Ningbo has recently become a social media sensation. The viral video features the most iconic landmarks of Ningbo, a coastal city in east China, with a particularly spectacular perspective.
The video is shot and produced by 19-year-old Zhou Yuquan, a local vocational high school student and drone videographer. “I just want to share the beauty of my city,” Zhou said.
The 131-second video is the culmination of 5TB of aerial footage plus 100 hours of color correction and editing over the span of an entire year. “Behind each second of footage is an hour of work.” To capture the city center in its full splendor—from dawn to dusk, amidst its bustling traffic, and beneath the nighttime city lights, Zhou ventured out whenever he had free time, equipped with his 40-kg camera gear. Carrying this hefty load, he traversed the city using public transportation. His journey underscores that photography is more than just a technical skill; it is truly test of determination.
