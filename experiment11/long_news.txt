A mural artist has single-handedly transformed his small village in southwestern China's Yunnan Province into a canvas for his imagination and his native Dai culture.Yan Wenjiao, 31, first began painting the walls of Manle Village in 2015 while an undergraduate art student. Back home for summer vacation, Yan painted the two characters for Manle  on the outside of his home."When the villagers saw what I painted, they thought it was pretty nice and I got many invitations to paint their walls," Yan said.After graduating in 2018 from the Hubei Institute of Fine Arts, Yan decided to devote his artistic talent to his hometown. Although appreciation for his work was among the reasons he returned, he also felt an overall improvement in the quality of life in Manle. "My hometown has seen a significant transformation in recent years because of rural revitalization through both environmental protection and infrastructure improvement. I feel at ease working here," Yan said. "Meanwhile, I can use my skills to better my community and the surrounding area, which gives me a sense of accomplishment. The goal was not only to leave my rural home to attend college, but to return to create a better future," he added.
